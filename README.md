This project showcases the beautiful possibility of paginating pages on the front end.

**notes and highlights:**

- uses github api
- uses custom hook (useFetch) to fetch data using api.
- uses array functions like Array.from to create array of arrays.
- best practice of creating utils.js for some functions

- _This mini project is ideal for limited number of pages._
- _By adding addtional logic, it can be used with infinite amount of pages as well_
- _The scss files have been kept for future references_
